<p>Hello, My name is Stelios Klapsis and this website is a project assignment for my Game 111: Web Design and Database Fundamentals class. On this website you will find a basic implementation of standard html tags as well as some personal information about myself. If you prefer to jump to a short list of the projects I have worked on instead you can simply press 
<a href="#games_list">HERE</a>.
Otherwise if you prefer to view my entire portfolio you can simply click on the face in the image above.

I was born in Quebec where I went through CEGEP and University later moving to Ontario to experience more of what Canada had to offer. I've worked a variety of jobs but I have always had a passion for programming and game developement. Without the benefit of a formalized education I started teaching myself how to code to create a foundation of knowledge. I began with HTML and CSS, later moving to the basic scripting languages Javascript and PHP. I then later moved on to some basic database work with mySQL. Before long I felt I had become proficient in their use and application however, that was not where my passion was,  it was just a stepping stone. I began to teach myself the object oriented languages begining with C# which over time has become my primary programing language for all the implementations I could want. Armed with the experience of C# under my belt I began to teach myself Unity and that is when I realized just how interested I was in the field. Finally, all of the work I had put in began to pay off and I could build almost anything I could visualize. For myself, this was a dream come true. Since then I have build a variety of games and software, always in the search of my next great challenge. While not all of my work is open source I do have a lot of my open source work on my Github which you can find 
<a href="https://github.com/BeyondTheEcho" target="_blank">HERE</a>.
<br>
<br>
As I began to plateau in my ability, I found myself interested in learning more. This led me to apply to the SLC Game Programming course in the hopes of finding a high quality formalized education in programming. Armed with a degree in this program I hope to one day find a job working in a stuido doing the thing I love more than anything else in the world - Making video games. 
<br>
<br>
In my personal time I persue a wide variety of interests from game developement and programming to Youtube and video editing. I also have a blog that I use to occasionally share my thoughts on gaming. My YouTube channel acts as an extension of this as I post both a gaming related podcast and game reviews. You can

Nelson Mandela once said
<q>
Courage is not the absence of fear, but the triumph over it. The brave man is not he who does not feel afraid, but he who conquers that fear.
</q>
This quote resonates with me on a deep level and has in many ways been a guiding factor in my life. I may be an adult returning to college, having taken a path that in retrospect I had not hoped to go down. In doing so I have wasted a lot of time. However, this will not stop me from following my passion, no matter how afraid that makes me.
<br>
<br>
Below you will also find a list of the classic video games I recreated on my journey of programming self discovery. If you are interested in additional information or want to see my portfolio you can click

<ol>
  <li>Pacman</li>
    <ul>
        <li class="caps">
            Pacman was the first game I attempted to recreated which proved to be a challenge. In retrospect I should have started with Pong.
        </li>
    </ul>
  <li>Pong</li>
    <ul>
        <li class="caps">
            Pong was fairly easy to create given preivous experience but still a good learning opportunity.
        </li>
    </ul>
  <li>Mario</li>
    <ul>
        <li class="caps">
            Maro was one of the more complex games from the NES era that I had ever worked on. It took considerable time to finish and polish.
        </li>
    </ul>
  <li>Galaga</li>
    <ul>
        <li class="caps">
            Galaga is my favorite classic game and thought it took forever to finish I enjoyed every moment of it.
        </li>
    </ul>
  <li>Brick Breaker</li>
    <ul>
        <li class="caps">
            Brick Breaker was an ideal game to learn how the physics system within Unity worked as well as the math needed to make it do what I wanted
        </li>
    </ul>
  <li>2D Racers</li>
    <ul>
        <li class="caps">
            I worked on a variety of differnt simple 2D racer games.
        </li>
    </ul>
  <li>2D Top Down Space Shooters</li>
    <ul>
        <li class="caps">
            This is a game I revisit time and again, perhaps it wormed its way into my heart as a child. Somehow they never seem to get old.

Don't be afraid to hold onto your unique vision: just be aware that it may not turn out exactly how you envisioned."
